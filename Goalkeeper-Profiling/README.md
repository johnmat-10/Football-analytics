# 🧤 Goalkeeper Performance Analysis & Profiling

A Python analytics suite that evaluates football goalkeepers based on Shot Stopping, Distribution, and Sweeping actions. It generates high-quality visualizations to identify elite performers and distinct playstyles.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `Data/`: Contains the dataset (FBref 2024-2025).
* `Output/`: Contains sample visualizations generated by the script.
* `main.py`: The core analysis script.

## 📊 Sample Output

### 1. Performance Matrix
A quadrant analysis comparing Shot Stopping (PSxG+/-) vs. Passing Reliability. Includes "Smart Labels" to avoid clutter and storytelling annotations to define player roles (e.g., "Complete Keeper" vs. "Traditional Shot Stopper").
